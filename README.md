# enlighten

This repository contains my [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site with source code which is built to keep all my notes/documentations I take during my technical learning under one roof. I have used [Hugo Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme to have pleasing look on my text. 

| The site is even hosted [here](https://selvarajan2006.github.io/enlighten/docs/).
