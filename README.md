# Enlighten

This repository contains my hugo site(with source) that is built to keep all my notes/documentations I take during the technical learnings under one roof. I have used [Hugo Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme to have pleasing doc look on my text. 

| The site is hosted [here](https://coder-selvarajan.github.io/enlighten/docs/).
