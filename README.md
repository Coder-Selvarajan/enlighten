# Enlighten

This repository contains the source of my wiki site built in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). The site displays all my notes that I take during my technical learnings. I have used [Hugo Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme to have pleasing doc look on my notes. Wiki site links is [here](https://coder-selvarajan.github.io/enlighten/docs/).
