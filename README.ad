This repository contains the source of my wiki site built in https://gohugo.io[Hugo]. The site displays all my notes that I take during my technical learnings. I have used https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book[Hugo Book] theme to have pleasing doc look on my notes. Checck out the site [here](https://coder-selvarajan.github.io/enlighten/docs/).
