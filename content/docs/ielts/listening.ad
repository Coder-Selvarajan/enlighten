== Listening Strategies

. Read the rubric (titles, instructions, question types) carefully.
. Glance through the questions
. Underline/circle/star key words in the question
. Predict what you might hear,
. Listen carefully if words are spelt for you, as there are different ways of spelling words
. Recognise paraphrases and synonyms as these may be used in the question.
. Check answers after every task (30 sec. to check).
. If you miss an answer don't panic, move on.
. If you can't decide between two answers, write down both and decide later.
. Always check your spelling. If you make a spelling mistake, your answer will be marked wrong.
